    //         verify that they did indeed want to agree to this loan according
    //         to these terms.
    // @param  _collateralRateInBasisPoints - Collateral rate in basis points 
    //         supplied from borrower to the partybid.
    // @param  _maximumRepaymentAmount - The maximum amount of money that the
    //         borrower would be required to retrieve their collateral. If
    //         interestIsProRated is set to false, then the borrower will
    //         always have to pay this amount to retrieve their collateral.
    // @param  _nftCollateralId - The ID within the NFTCollateralContract for
    //         the NFT being used as collateral for this loan. The NFT is
    //         stored within this contract during the duration of the loan.
    // @param  _loanDuration - The amount of time (measured in seconds) that can
    //         elapse before the lender can liquidate the loan and seize the
    //         underlying collateral NFT.
    // @param  _loanInterestRateForDurationInBasisPoints - The interest rate
    //         (measured in basis points, e.g. hundreths of a percent) for the
    //         loan, that must be repaid pro-rata by the borrower at the
    //         conclusion of the loan or risk seizure of their nft collateral.
    // @param  _adminFeeInBasisPoints - The percent (measured in basis
    //         points) of the interest earned that will be taken as a fee by
    //         the contract admins when the loan is repaid. The fee is stored
    //         in the loan struct to prevent an attack where the contract
    //         admins could adjust the fee right before a loan is repaid, and
    //         take all of the interest earned.
    // @param  _borrowerNonce - The nonce referred to here
    //         is not the same as an Ethereum account's nonce. We are referring
    //         instead to nonces that are used by both the lender and the
    //         borrower when they are first signing off-chain NFTfi orders.
    //         These nonces can be any uint256 value that the user has not
    //         previously used to sign an off-chain order. Each nonce can be
    //         used at most once per user within NFTfi, regardless of whether
    //         they are the lender or the borrower in that situation. This
    //         serves two purposes. First, it prevents replay attacks where an
    //         attacker would submit a user's off-chain order more than once.
    //         Second, it allows a user to cancel an off-chain order by calling
    //         NFTfi.cancelLoanCommitmentBeforeLoanHasBegun(), which marks the
    //         nonce as used and prevents any future loan from using the user's
    //         off-chain order that contains that nonce.
    // @param  _nftCollateralContract - The ERC721 contract of the NFT
    //         collateral
    // @param  _loanERC20Denomination - The ERC20 contract of the currency being
    //         used as principal/interest for this loan.
    // @param  _borrower - The address of the borrower. 
    // @param  _interestIsProRated - A boolean value determining whether the
    //         interest will be pro-rated if the loan is repaid early, or
    //         whether the borrower will simply pay maximumRepaymentAmount.
    // @param  _borrowerSignature - The ECDSA signature of the borrower,
    //         obtained off-chain ahead of time, signing the following
    //         combination of parameters: _loanPrincipalAmount,
    //         _maximumRepaymentAmount _nftCollateralId, _loanDuration,
