// @title  Main contract for NFTfi. This contract manages the ability to create
//         NFT-backed peer-to-peer loans.
// @author smartcontractdev.eth, creator of wrappedkitties.eth, cwhelper.eth, and
//         kittybounties.eth
// @notice There are five steps needed to commence an NFT-backed loan. First,
//         the borrower calls nftContract.approveAll(NFTfi), approving the NFTfi
//         contract to move their NFT's on their behalf. Second, the borrower
//         signs an off-chain message for each NFT that they would like to
//         put up for collateral. This prevents borrowers from accidentally
//         lending an NFT that they didn't mean to lend, due to approveAll()
//         approving their entire collection. Third, the lender calls
//         erc20Contract.approve(NFTfi), allowing NFTfi to move the lender's
//         ERC20 tokens on their behalf. Fourth, the lender signs an off-chain
//         message, proposing the amount, rate, and duration of a loan for a
//         particular NFT. Fifth, the borrower calls NFTfi.beginLoan() to
//         accept these terms and enter into the loan. The NFT is stored in the
//         contract, the borrower receives the loan principal in the specified
//         ERC20 currency, and the lender receives an NFTfi promissory note (in
//         ERC721 form) that represents the rights to either the
//         principal-plus-interest, or the underlying NFT collateral if the
//         borrower does not pay back in time. The lender can freely transfer
//         and trade this ERC721 promissory note as they wish, with the
//         knowledge that transferring the ERC721 promissory note tranfsers the
//         rights to principal-plus-interest and/or collateral, and that they
//         will no longer have a claim on the loan. The ERC721 promissory note
//         itself represents that claim.
// @notice A loan may end in one of two ways. First, a borrower may call
//         NFTfi.payBackLoan() and pay back the loan plus interest at any time,
//         in which case they receive their NFT back in the same transaction.
//         Second, if the loan's duration has passed and the loan has not been
//         paid back yet, a lender can call NFTfi.liquidateOverdueLoan(), in
//         which case they receive the underlying NFT collateral and forfeit
//         the rights to the principal-plus-interest, which the borrower now
//         keeps.
// @notice If the loan was agreed to be a pro-rata interest loan, then the user
//         only pays the principal plus pro-rata interest if repaid early.
//         However, if the loan was agreed to be a fixed-repayment loan (by
//         specifying UINT32_MAX as the value for
//         loanInterestRateForDurationInBasisPoints), then the borrower pays
//         the maximumRepaymentAmount regardless of whether they repay early
//         or not.
